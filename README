tasks, or I use while teaching Programming or Photography Workflow.

Scripts
=======

share a common ancestor directory.

check_backup
------------

Verifies which changes will be made to the backup once it is performed.

error, it only reports and summarizes the errors.

Given an image, create several copies of the image with different sizes
that are required by iOS applications.

make_iso.sh
