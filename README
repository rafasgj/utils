This repository stores some utility scripts I use to automate some 
tasks, or I use while teaching Programming or Photography Workflow.

Scripts
=======

backup_catalog
--------------

Performs a backup of the entire Adobe's Lightroom Catalog and image
library to one or two destinations. It assumes the catalog and images
share a common ancestor directory.

### Configuration

The following variables must be configured in the file
`${HOME}/.config/backup_catalog/config`:

* MASTER_DISKS:
    An array of master directories. For example, a disk name "Images",
    with two directories "catalog" and "documents", and only catalog is
    to be backed up would give an entry like `MASTER_DISKS=("Images/catalog")`
    or `MASTER_DISKS=("/Volumes/Images/catalog")`. Multiple entres are
    separated by `spaces`.

* BK1 and BK2:
    The name or mount point of the two backup disks. Example: `BK1=Backup_1`
    or `BK1=/Volumes/Backup_1`.


check_backup
------------

Verifies which changes will be made to the backup once it is performed.

verify_backup
-------------

Verify errors on the last backup performed. It does not fixes any 
error, it only reports and summarizes the errors.

create_ios_icons.sh
-------------------

Given an image, create several copies of the image with different sizes
that are required by iOS applications.

make_iso.sh
-----------

Given a directory, create an ISO image suited for macOS, Linux and
Windows, using macOS _hidutil_.

pysum.sh
--------

Computes the hash sum of a file or the stdin. By default, uses MD5 as
hashing algorithm. Other algorithms available are sha224, sha256,
sha384 and sha512. Link to md5sum, or sha256sum to change the algorithm
used.
